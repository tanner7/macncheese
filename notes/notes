// These are some useful notes about this project and the process:

1. Copied my existing react project to be redone as macncheese

2. setup git repo on github

3. renaming all the components etc..


//
PROPS

Props are how components talk to each other

props are similar to function calls where you can pass arguments

- props should not change

to make props optional add defaultProps to a class:

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

Welcome.defaultProps = {
  name: "world",
};


//
STATE

use state when the component needs to keep track between renderings, the component is able to create, update and  use state. 

for example use state when a user inputs data directly to the component


- setState:
setState updates the state and re-renders the component automatically
