1. Copied my existing react project to be redone as macncheese

2. setup git repo on github

3. renaming all the components etc..







CURRENTLY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


figuring out how to add new note...

need to set AddNotes state to include both name, content and then transfer that to NoteList
